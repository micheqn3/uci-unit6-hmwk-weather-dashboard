## UCI Homework #6 Weather Dashboard

This repository contains a weather dashboard that collects the user input, fetches the city's data from Open Weather API, 
displays it onto the page, and appends the recent history searches onto the side bar.

### This repository contains: 

  - index.html- This file contains the layout of the weather dashboard and includes additional styling powered by Bootstrap.

  - script.js- This script fetches the data from Open Weather API including city name, country, temperature, wind, humidity, and 5 day weather 
  information in order to fill the text content of the elements targeted by JQUERY. The application will save all of this data into local
  storage and append these items into the History side bar for the user to look back at their recent searches.

  - style.css- This file provides additional styling to the page.

  - reset.css- This file will force every browser to have all of its styles reset to null.
